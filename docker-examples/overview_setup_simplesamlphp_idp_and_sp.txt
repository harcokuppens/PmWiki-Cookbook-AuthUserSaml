SHORT overview 
---------------

SHORT setup IdP  
   1 Configuring the IdP 
         enable idp mode and basic_auth_module in software and configure salt/email        => config/config.php  
         and authentication                                                                => config/authsources.php
         Configuring the IdP's metadata  (certificate/authsource/attributes.NameFormat)    => metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php
   2 exchange metadata with IdP
     a) Adding SPs to the IdP.             => metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php
     b) Adding this IdP to other SPs => see setup SP 2a)      

  => if you skip step 2 (no sp setup) then you can still test the authentication module :
     using the idp server itself
       
        Click the "Authentication" tab => click the link "Test configured authentication sources" =>  click the link "userpass" 
        and login with one of the test credentials.
    
      
SHORT setup SP: 
  1 Configuring the SP 
      enable sp mode in software and configure certificate and default idp   => config/authsources.php
  2 exchange metadata with IdP
     a) Adding IdPs to the SP           metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php
     b) Adding this SP to other IdPs  => see setup IdP 2a)

SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider QuickStart
-----------------------------------------
src: https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/latest/simplesamlphp-sp.html
      or 
     SimpleSAMLphp_Service_Provider_QuickStart.pdf
      
1. Configuring the SP => config/authsources.php

  The SP is configured by an entry in config/authsources.php .

  This is a minimal authsources.php for a SP:

    <?php
    $config = [

        /* This is the name of this authentication source, and will be used to access it later. */
        'default-sp' => [
            'saml:SP',
        ],
    ];
  
  
  If you want multiple Service Providers in the same site and installation, you can add more entries in the authsources.php configuration. 
  If so remember to set the EntityID explicitly. Here is an example:

      'sp1' => [
          'saml:SP',
        'entityID' => 'https://sp1.example.org/',
      ],
      'sp2' => [
          'saml:SP',
        'entityID' => 'https://sp2.example.org/',
      ],
 
2. OPTIONAL: Enabling a certificate for your Service Provider   => authsources.php 

   Some Identity Providers / Federations may require that your Service Providers holds a certificate. If you enable a certificate for your Service Provider, it may be
   able to sign requests and response sent to the Identity Provider, as well as receiving encrypted responses.

   Create a self-signed certificate in the cert/ directory:

        cd cert
        openssl req -newkey rsa:3072 -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out saml.crt -keyout saml.pem

    Then edit your authsources.php entry, and add references to your certificate:

    'default-sp' => [
        'saml:SP',
        'privatekey' => 'saml.pem',
        'certificate' => 'saml.crt',
    ],
  

3. Adding IdPs to the SP   => metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php

  
  The service provider you are configuring needs to know about the identity providers you are going to connect to it. This is configured by metadata stored in
  metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php . This is a minimal example of a metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php metadata file:

    <?php
    $metadata['https://example.com'] = [
        'SingleSignOnService'  => 'https://example.com/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php',
        'SingleLogoutService'  => 'https://example.com/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SingleLogoutService.php',
        'certificate'          => 'example.pem',
    ];
  example.pem under your cert/ directory contains the certificate the identity provider uses for signing assertions.
  
  
4. Setting the default IdP  => config/authsources.php

  An option in the authentication source allows you to configure which IdP should be used. This is the idp option.
  
    <?php
    $config = [

        'default-sp' => [
            'saml:SP',

            /*
             * The entity ID of the IdP this should SP should contact.
             * Can be NULL/unset, in which case the user will be shown a list of available IdPs.
             */
            'idp' => 'https://idp.example.com',             # note for idp added in step 3 the value should be 'https://example.com'
        ],
    ];
    
    
5. Exchange metadata with the IdP

 a) send the metadata of your SP to the IdP
 
 b) add the metadata of the IdP to your SP         => done in step 3. above
      into the metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php
      
 
TEST) Test the SP

   After the metadata is configured on the IdP, you should be able to test the configuration. The admin module of SimpleSAMLphp has a tab to test authentication
   sources. There you should a list of authentication sources, including the one you have created for the SP.

   After you click the link for that authentication source, you will be redirected to the IdP. After entering your credentials, you should be redirected back to the
   test page. The test page should contain a list of your attributes:



SHORT: quick setup SP (which basicly is an interface to authsource (idp))

  config sp  => config/authsources.php
  
          <?php
          $config = [

              'default-sp' => [
                  'saml:SP',

                   /* OPTIONAL
                      enable a certificate for your Service Provider, it may be
                      able to sign requests and response sent to the Identity Provider, 
                      as well as receiving encrypted responses from the Identity Provider.
                   /* 
                  'privatekey' => 'saml.pem',
                  'certificate' => 'saml.crt',
          
                  /*
                   * The entity ID of the IdP this should SP should contact.
                   * Can be NULL/unset, in which case the user will be shown a list of available IdPs.
                   */
                  'idp' => 'https://idp.example.com',             # note for idp added in step 3 the value should be 'https://example.com'
              ],
          ];  
 
 
 exchange metadata with IdP          
          
  Adding IdPs to the SP   => metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php

  
      The service provider you are configuring needs to know about the identity providers you are going to connect to it. This is configured by metadata stored in
      metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php . This is a minimal example of a metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php metadata file:

        <?php
        $metadata['https://example.com'] = [
            'SingleSignOnService'  => 'https://example.com/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php',
            'SingleLogoutService'  => 'https://example.com/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SingleLogoutService.php',
            'certificate'          => 'example.pem',
        ];
    
      example.pem under your cert/ directory contains the certificate the identity provider uses for signing assertions.
                    
  Send the metadata of your SP to the IdP          
  
       The metadata of your SP can be found in the Federation tab of the web interface. Copy the SAML 2.0 XML Metadata document automatically generated by
       SimpleSAMLphp and send it to the administrator of the IdP.
             
             

SHORT setup SP: 
  1 Configuring the SP 
      enable sp mode in software and configure certificate and default idp   => config/authsources.php
  2 exchange metadata with IdP
     a) Adding IdPs to the SP           metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php
     b) Adding this SP to other IdPs  => see setup IdP 2a)
             

                
SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider QuickStart
-------------------------------------------           
src: https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/latest/simplesamlphp-idp.html    
      or SimpleSAMLphp_Identity_Provider_QuickStart.pdf         
             
configure Idp =>  config/config.php             
   
   The option enable.saml20-idp controls whether SAML 2.0 IdP support is enabled. Enable it by assigning true to them:

     'enable.saml20-idp' => true,
    
  The exampleauth:UserPass authentication module is part of the exampleauth module. This module isn't enabled by default, so you will have to enable it in config.php 

      'module.enable' => [
           'exampleauth' => true,
           â€¦
      ],


Configuring the IdP's metadata => metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php

    The SAML 2.0 IdP is configured by the metadata stored in metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php . This is a minimal configuration:

      <?php
      $metadata['__DYNAMIC:1__'] = [
          /*
           * The hostname for this IdP. This makes it possible to run multiple
           * IdPs from the same configuration. '__DEFAULT__' means that this one
           * should be used by default.
           */
          'host' => '__DEFAULT__',

          /*
           * The private key and certificate to use when signing responses.
           * These are stored in the cert-directory.
           */
          'privatekey' => 'example.org.pem',
          'certificate' => 'example.org.crt',

          /*
           * The authentication source which should be used to authenticate the
           * user. This must match one of the entries in config/authsources.php.
           */
          'auth' => 'example-userpass',
          
          /*
           *   attributes should be delivered using the urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri NameFormat
           */       
          'attributes.NameFormat' => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri',
          'authproc' => [
              // Convert LDAP names to oids.
              100 => ['class' => 'core:AttributeMap', 'name2oid'],
          ],
          
      ];
  
    For more information about available options in the idp-hosted metadata files, see the IdP hosted reference .


  
Configuration for authentication  =>  config/authsources.php .

  In this setup, this file should contain a single entry:

  <?php
  $config = [
    'example-userpass' => [
      'exampleauth:UserPass',
      'student:studentpass' => [
        'uid' => ['student'],
        'eduPersonAffiliation' => ['member', 'student'],
      ],
      'employee:employeepass' => [
        'uid' => ['employee'],
        'eduPersonAffiliation' => ['member', 'employee'],
      ],
    ],
  ];
 
  This configuration creates two users - student and employee , with the passwords studentpass and employeepass . The username and password are stored in the array index ( student:studentpass for the student -user). The attributes for each user are configured in the array referenced by the index.
       
       
exchange metadata with IdP 

    Adding SPs to the IdP.  => metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php
    
       The identity provider you are configuring needs to know about the service providers you are going to connect to it. This is configured by metadata stored in
       metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php . This is a minimal example of a metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php metadata file for a SimpleSAMLphp SP:

          <?php
          $metadata['https://sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/metadata.php/default-sp'] = [
              'AssertionConsumerService' => 'https://sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/default-sp',
              'SingleLogoutService'      => 'https://sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-logout.php/default-sp',
          ];
   
       Note that the URI in the entityID and the URLs to the AssertionConsumerService and SingleLogoutService endpoints change between different service providers. If
       you have the metadata of the remote SP as an XML file, you can use the built-in XML to SimpleSAMLphp metadata converter, which by default is available as
       /admin/metadata-converter.php in your SimpleSAMLphp installation.

       For more information about available options in the sp-remote metadata files, see the SP remote reference .

    Adding this IdP to other SPs
     
       The method for adding this IdP to a SP varies between different types of SPs. In general, most SPs need some metadata from the IdP. This should be available
       from /saml2/idp/metadata.php .


   
SHORT setup IdP  
   1 Configuring the IdP 
         enable idp mode and basic_auth_module in software and configure salt/email        => config/config.php
